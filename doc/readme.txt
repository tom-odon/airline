Name: Thomas Odon (Tom)
Hours spent:

		Initial logic implementation: 
		
		JUnit test 1 ~1 hr
		JUnit test 2 ~1 hr
		Junit test 3 ~30 min

		Implementing and populating HSQL DB: ~2 hrs + lecture/office hours check for correct info
	
		Implementing JDBC: ~30 mins
		
		Adding SQL queries and functionality:
		
		Junit test 1 ~1hr
		Junit test 2 ~45 mins
		Junit test 3 ~20 mins
		
The biggest issues I had- time management. 
Should have started project earlier, should have asked more questions earlier. 

There could be more details on JDBC connections being established as well as HSQL. 
To get the information for initializing both, I had to go back to lecture video
and slides and re-play and pause to make sure each step was correct. I would say that
maybe a PDF outlining the steps is best, instead of spreading the info across slides.
I don't know about other students, but I take notes in lecture on big-picture items and
then search references for minute details. 

I think the project was very helpful in understanding how to implement a DB, get it 
populated and running, and making one work in a Java setting. I was genuinely happy
when my JUnits ran correctly. 

I did change a couple things. In the JUnit tests for referencing airports, I used only 
airport codes instead of AIRPORT_XXX. I added some no-parameter constructors to some 
of the non-test classes. If this affects the outcome of the project, please let me know.
